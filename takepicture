OPTIONS:

-f          fuzz           fuzz value used a threshold for removing any white areas from the scan
                           if brighest area of the film base is 75% then the threshold should be less than 25%
                           expressed as (integer) percent 0 to 100;
                           default=25
-m          mirror         flips the image after it has been cropped usefull if the negative was scanned emulsion down
-r          rotate         rotates the image after being cropped, positive integer <= 360
-a          all boxes      include crops of all boxes, inluding the gaps between frames usefull for debugging
-e          extend         extends the crop X pixels
-s          show mask      show how the mask was created usefull for debugging
-n          frane number   the starting frame number to use file name defaults to #1
